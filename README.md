# Greet Bot
Project Objective
1.	To develop a robot that can recognize the face of a person and greet him/her in real time.
2.	The robot should give the directions of certain locations when asked.

Project Details
When the robot detects the human using the Mediapipe person pose library, it will move towards it by following a black line. After reaching near to the person, his/her face is detected using the Mediapipe face mesh library. This ML model detected 468 landmarks on the face of a person. An algorithm has been developed to reorient the camera of the robot so that the detected face is in the middle of the camera. If multiple faces are present in the video frame, then the camera is reoriented such that maximum number of faces are in the camera frame. Face recognition is performed using the face recognition library of python. The comparison will be made using 128 features between the person on the camera frame and the person in the database. Our system will interact with people around using Natural Language Processing. The audio input is done through the microphone and a real time audio processing is performed to get the output sentence.
